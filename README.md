Step 1: Download the repository files using the "CODE" tab and clicking on "Download ZIP".
Step 2: Navigate to your world folder and go into datapacks.
Step 3: Create a folder named "BTurtle" or whatever you want it to be. Then, extract the contents of the ZIP into the folder.
Step 4 (Optional): You might want to delete the "LICENSE" and "README.md" files, as they are not needed.
